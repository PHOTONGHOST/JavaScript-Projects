This Repository contains my JavaScript projects for my JavaScript school projects. This README will be updated as new content gets added to this repository.

Some notable projects that you will find in this section include: 
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game:
The player goes up against the computer who picks randome spaces on the grid. Who ever gets 3 in a row first, wins!

A very standard 4 funstion calculater that uses add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

And A Pizza Menu!
A pizza menu used for ordering pizza, comes with the ablilite to select pizza sizes and toppins. It then adds it all up to a total price for oyur order.
